# Analyzing the Effectiveness of an Airline Loyalty Program Promotion

Welcome to the GitHub repository for a analysis on the impact of a promotional campaign on an airline's loyalty program. In this project, I delve into a comprehensive dataset obtained from Kaggle, which includes customer loyalty history, flight activity, and demographic information. The primary focus is on assessing the effectiveness of a promotional campaign aimed at boosting program enrollments.

## Research Questions

1. Did the promotional campaign lead to an increase in loyalty program memberships?
2. Was there a noticeable uptick in flight bookings as a result of the promotional campaign?
3. How did demographic factors influence the success of the promotional campaign?
4. Can we predict the risk of loyalty program cancellations using customer data?

## Dataset

The dataset consists of two CSV files:

1. **Customer Loyalty History.csv**: Contains details about customers, including demographics, enrollment information, and cancellation details.
2. **Customer Flight Activity.csv**: Provides information on flights booked by loyalty program members.

You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/agungpambudi/airline-loyalty-campaign-program-impact-on-flights?select=Customer+Flight+Activity.csv).

## Analysis Steps

1. **Descriptive Data Analysis**: I performed an initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure and cleanliness.
2. **Demographic vs. Promotional Campaign**: Analyzing how the promotional campaign influenced enrollments across different demographic factors.
3. **Flight Activity vs. Promotional Campaign**: Investigating the impact of the campaign on flight bookings, including seasonal trends.
4. **Loyalty Membership Cancellations - Prediction**: Building a predictive model to identify factors contributing to loyalty program cancellations.

## Code Implementation

The analysis is conducted using Python and popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn. Key steps include data loading, cleaning, visualization, statistical tests, and machine learning modeling.

The Jupyter notebook provides a step-by-step walkthrough of the entire analysis, offering insights and visualizations at each stage.

## Insights and Recommendations

The analysis concludes with valuable insights into the effectiveness of the promotional campaign, highlighting its impact on enrollments, flight bookings, and loyalty membership cancellations. These findings can inform strategic decisions and improvements in future marketing initiatives.

Feel free to explore the code, run the notebook, and adapt it to your specific needs. I hope this analysis contributes to a better understanding of loyalty program dynamics and informs data-driven decision-making in the airline industry.
